Resources gathered while I learn about RL.

As of now, it contains the notes I took while watching [David Silver's course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZBiG_XpjnPrSNw-1XQaM_gB), as well as some very basic experiments.

The notes can be freely accessed and read in an appropriate format [on this website](https://pepborrell.github.io/rl/)
